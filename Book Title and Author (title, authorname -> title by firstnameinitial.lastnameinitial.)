#This program takes input to make a list of books with corresponding author names,
#seperated by characters. It then splits up the list and joins it together until
#it has created one that includes title, first name, and last name seperately.
#It then iterates through each word in the list and outputs the book title "by"
#the initials of the author's first and last name.
